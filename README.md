# Dataprogramming
The objective of the project is to analyze the correlation between weight and Nutrition, Sleep and Exercise.

PART 1

1. Idea of the project -  The objective of the project is to analyze the correlation between weight and Nutrition, Sleep and Exercise.
2. General intention with the dataset - The dataset obtained is to be cleaned, broken down and analyzed so as to find the correlation between different categories of the dataset i.e weight and Nutrition, Sleep and Exercise.
3. Potential weaknesses of the project - Was rather difficult to have an exact finding on sleep against weight loss since one cannot have consistent time of sleeping in any given time. Also, some of the meals taken (Nutrition) may have alcoholic content leading to a skewed finding.

PART 2

1. The project - The objective of the project is to analyze the correlation between weight and Nutrition, Sleep and Exercise.
Key findings: Increased activity leads to weight loss. Nutrition with less calories helps one not gain weight. Sleep is important in weight loss.
2. Visualizations - As seen below. Images of the same uploaded too.
3. Weakness/uncertainty, and suggests further work- Was rather difficult to have an exact finding on sleep against weight loss since one cannot have consistent time of sleeping in any given time. Also, some of the meals taken (Nutrition) may have alcoholic content leading to a skewed finding. Suggested further work would be extrapolating the data analysis so as to derive the expected weight loss or gain in the future if excercise, nutrition and sleep variables are kept constant.
